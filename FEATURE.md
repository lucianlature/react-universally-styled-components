# Style - Styled Components

[![Styled Components logo](https://styled-components.com/static/media/logo.333814ad.png "Styled Components")](http://styled-components.com/)

This is a feature repository of [`react-universally`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally), currently built against `v10.1.1`.

It provides you with a simple Style Components integration.

  Also, there is a [PR pending](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/214) for SSR support, so this functionality is not _yet_ available for this branch.
